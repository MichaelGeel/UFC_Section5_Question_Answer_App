# UFC_Section5_Question_Answer_App
The Ultimate Flask Course Section 5 by Anthony Herbert.

This section is used to further cement the concepts that have been taught up until now to build an app that involves the asking and answering of questions by users. This app is more advanced and utilizes a broader array of concepts in comparison to the previous app and further builds upon skill and knowledge gained thus far.

As per usual for this course, thorough note taking will be done and can be accessed in the accompanying Section5_Notes.txt file.

The Question and Answer App is an app whereby users can register to ask questions on the app. These questions can then be answers by other users who have the permissions to do so granted. The app displays a backlog of the unanswered questions as well as an archive of questions that have been answered. And any question that gets answered automatically goes into the archive. Lastly, when a user is finished with their objectives on the app, there is a log out functionality as well.

Note that on the backend of the app, there is permission control using sessions and the particulars of the logged in user, for example, a new user cannot answer questions as they do not have the necessary permissions to do so.
