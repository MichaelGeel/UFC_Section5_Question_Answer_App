# The Question-Answer App

## Lesson 49) Demo

The app we'll be making allows users to ask questions and allows promoted experts to answer asked questions.
A logged in user can ask questions directed to experts, and when that expert logs in they can see all the questions that
were directed to them.
Once they answer the question, that question will be shown on the home screen with a list of other questions and when you 
click on a question, you can view the answer to the question.
There are multiple roles in the app, as well as log in and log out functionalities.

## Lesson 50) Overview of Templates:

We'll start by looking through the template files provided to start this project.
There are 8 template files that'll comprise the parts of the app that a user will be able to go to.
We have the home template with a list of questions already answered by an expert.
Then registration page for users to register to the app.
A log in page for registered users to log in.
The Ask a Question template page, lets you type in a question and select an expert to ask, then submit.
The Answer page for experts to answer questions directed to them.
The Question template page to view a question and answer and relevant details.
An unanswered questions page for an expert to view all the unanswered questions directed at them.
Lastly, there's a User List page wherein an admin can manage the users and experts in the page.
